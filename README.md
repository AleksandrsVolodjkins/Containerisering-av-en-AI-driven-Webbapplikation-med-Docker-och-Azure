The present thesis describes the development and deployment of a web-based emotion detection application utilizing deep learning and computer vision technologies. The Flask framework was employed to create the application, which integrates OpenCV for real-time face detection and a convolutional neural network model for emotion classification. Deployed on Azure using Docker, the application processes live webcam feeds to recognize and display human emotions dynamically. Preliminary results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in recognizing seven distinct emotions, providing a robust tool for studies in fields requiring emotion analysis.
